# Tasks

## 1.Calculate the sum of numbers in an array of numbers

```js
const ar = [2, 3, -1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 95];
const sum = sumArray(ar);
console.log("Sum :", sum); // Sum : 145
```

## 2.Fizz buzz

Task: The so called FizzBuzz program is a basic programming exercise commonly
used as a job interview question. The program usually comprises of printing a
certain set of numbers from 1 to 100, but with a certain twist:

When the number is a multiples of three, you print Fizz instead of the number
When the number is a multiples of five, you print Buzz instead of the number
When the number are the multiples of both three and five, you print FizzBuzz
instead of the number
